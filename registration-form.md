# The Registration Form

## Link
`https://script.google.com/macros/s/AKfycbw9yov3sDA-4K0N4K5bdj_78HyM6idKyGUmz_Cv9oIHPpGKGzc/exec`

To get to the registration form for an open event, the url needs to include two parameters
- v=reg
- id={event-id}

`As an example, this will load the registration form for event 3EED34E, /exec?v=reg&id=3EED34E`

If the link is used without any parameters, an Event List page will display. This page shows all the existing events and its current status. If an event is "Open", there will be a Sign Up button that will take you to the form. If you right click on the button, you can copy link with the necessary parameters already included.
