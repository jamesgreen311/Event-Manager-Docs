# Registration Data
The attendees registration data is stored in the Event sheet. The event count pivot table draws from this sheet. As new registrations are entered into this sheet, the pivot table will automatically update the summary data. Each row in this sheet will include the id and title of the event registered. Each attendees name, email, phone number and comments are found in this sheet. It will also contain a timestamp indicating when the attendee registered.
