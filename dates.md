# Dates
The Event Manager has two date fields; the Start of an event and the End of an event. Only the Start date is required.

## Format <br>
Both dates can be displayed in any valid date format supported by Google Sheets. The display format can vary from event to event. To set the display format for either date, select the date cell, and then click the Format > Number menu options. Previously used date formats will appear at the bottom of the menu list. If the format you are looking for does not appear in this list, select the More Formats > More date and time formats option.

The default options can be changed, removed or placed in a different order. Clicking the drop down arrow (1) will display more options to select from.
