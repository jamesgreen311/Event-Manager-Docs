Only board members have access to the document. It may take a couple seconds to appear but you should see a new menu option in the top menu bar right next to Help called MRAA Options. The drop down menu contains two options; Create a New Event &amp; Create Multiple Events. Make sure the current tab or sheet is the Event Master. This is where the new Event Id will be created. Each event must be assigned a unique Id. Click the MRAA Options menu, then select the Create a New Event option. A new ID will be added to the first blank row. The new event will automatically be set to a Planned status. If you have several events you need to add all at once, you can use the Create Multiple Events menu option. Selecting the Create Muliple Events option will launch a dialog window with a number field (1) and a Generate Event Id button (2). Select the number of events you would like to create and then click the button. The dialog window will stay open until you click the X (3) in the upper right to close it. The Event Id and Event Status are the only required fields in the Event Master but a Title, Start and Location are the minimum that should be entered if the form is open to the public. Subtitle The Subtitle will be displayed on the form below the Title. Start The Start can be just the date or the date and the start time. End The End date is not required but can be used to indicate the duration of the event. It can be entered as just the date or date and time. If you only want to show an end time, both the date and time must be entered. Both the Start and End dates can be formatted in any valid date format that you wish per event. But the format that is chosen will display that date wherever it appears. See Dates for more information. Location The location is freeform text. It will appear all on one line in the form but will wrap to the next line if it’s very long. Max Max is the maximum number of participants allowed to enter the event. It is not required and will not display if left blank. If a number is entered, it is only used as an indicator on the form. It does not impose a cut-off for registration. Contact Name &amp; Contact Email The Contact Name and Email are to provide a contact for the registrant to ask questions. ",
